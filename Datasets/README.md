# Datasets to download:

This is where the datasets will be stored LOCALLY.
It's generally not useful to upload the datasets to the GitHub repo since GitHub has a filesize limit and we don't know the memory limits of each of our computers.

I think the best way to handle this is to put the links to the datasets we use/make below (that way we control how much data is downloaded while still having the same file structure):

Example file structure:

Big-Data-Challenge-2020

|- <name of the dataset1 folder>

|- |- \<link to dataset1\>

|- |- ...

|- \<name of the dataset2 folder\>

|- |- \<link to dataset2\>

|- |- ...

TODO: make a .gitignore for this folder to ignore the datasets
